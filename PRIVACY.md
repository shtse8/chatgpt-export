# Privacy Policy — ChatGPT Export

**Last updated:** February 14, 2026

## Overview

ChatGPT Export is a browser extension that exports your ChatGPT conversations to local files. Your privacy is important to us.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any user data.** Specifically:

- No personally identifiable information is collected
- No conversation data leaves your browser
- No analytics or tracking is used
- No data is sent to external servers
- No cookies are set by this extension

## How It Works

The extension operates entirely within your browser. It reads conversation data from the ChatGPT web interface and converts it into downloadable files (JSON, Markdown, or plain text) that are saved directly to your device.

## Permissions

- **activeTab**: Used to inject the export UI into the active ChatGPT tab when you click the extension icon
- **storage**: Used to save your export preferences (e.g., default format) locally in your browser
- **Host access to chatgpt.com**: Required to read conversation data from the ChatGPT interface

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not integrate with or send data to any third-party services.

## Changes

If this policy changes, we will update it here with a new date.
